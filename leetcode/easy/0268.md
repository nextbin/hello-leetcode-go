## [234. Palindrome Linked List][1]

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```
Note:

Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

## 解题思路

考虑时间 O(n)，不能嵌套for或者for+map

考虑空间 O(1)，前n项和公式 0+1+...+n = (0+n)*(n+1)/2
